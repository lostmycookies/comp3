    "# Nutrition Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "## Joseph Cantwell, Adam Davidson, Olive Grace Oliveros, Marlene Perez, Benjamin Polzin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a proposal for the Computational Methods III course which will use methods learned in class such as Cloud Computing and the use of a git repository to obtain data and create a Dash dashboard then hosting it on AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "An unbalanced nutritional profile amongst the majority of the world’s population is an increasing problem causing a myriad of health-related concerns and increased risk of disease. Due to the ever-growing demand of “quick and easy” foods, which inherently are composed of highly processed, caloric dense, sugar-ladened ingredients and unhealthy fats, it becomes increasingly difficult for an individual to make healthier food choices in daily life. Especially in the military where mission is first, health and fitness sometimes becomes unprioritized in order to successfully complete a mission. Combined with a busy schedule, lack of healthier food options, and perhaps misleading nutritional information available, fueling the body with proper nutrients to meet the military’s rigorous demands becomes a daunting task and often gets overlooked, thus leading to increased multitude of health-related risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "A healthy diet is an important component to maintain and improve overall health. It helps to protect against health-related risk factors including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Additionally, it can be an important element in the treatment of specific conditions like hypertension, obesity, and auto-immune disorders. Helping people making informed decisions about their nutrition and adjusting it to their specific needs is essential to keep current and future generations healthy across the lifespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we doing to solve this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using cloud computing and git as learned in this course, we will develop a \"Nutritional Dashboard” which will give the user easy access to nutrition related information in order to increase awareness of the composition of their food intake.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How will you know you have succeeded?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have succeeded when we have a working interactive dashboard with an intuitive interface that provides the user with aggregated information about common foods, including calorie and macro counts."
